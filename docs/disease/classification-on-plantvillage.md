# Disease classification on PlantVillage

In this chapter, we will design a CNN to perform the plant disease classification task on the PlantVillage dataset. This includes several steps, which are outlined below:

1. Explore and preprocess the PlantVillage dataset
2. Design an isotropic CNN architecture
3. Train the CNN on the PlantVillage dataset
4. Analyze accuracy of the CNN model from the angle of hierarchical confusion matrix
